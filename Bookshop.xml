      <Bks:Authors>Charles Darwin</Bks:Authors>
      <Bks:Abstract>Darwin's theory of natural selection
       issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought
       and belief: no being or species has been specifically
       created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existence,
      with extinction looming for those not fitted for the task.</Bks:Abstract>

      <Bks:Abstract>In the book, Sagan explores 15 billion years of cosmic
       evolution and the development of science and civilization.

       biographical anecdotes about many prominent scientists throughout history,

      <Bks:Authors>Douglas Hofstadter</Bks:Authors>
      <Bks:Abstract>Douglas Hofstadter's book is concerned directly with the nature
       of “maps” or links between formal systems. However, according to
       Hofstadter, the formal system that underlies all mental activity
       transcends the system that supports it. If life can grow out of the
       formal chemical substrate of the cell, if consciousness can emerge out
       of a formal system of firing neurons, then so too will computers
       attain human intelligence. Gödel, Escher, Bach is a wonderful
       exploration of fascinating ideas at the heart of cognitive science:
       meaning, reduction, recursion, and much more.</Bks:Abstract>
